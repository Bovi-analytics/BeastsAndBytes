# Learning Outcomes

By the end of Week 2, students will be able to: - Explain real-world data governance and ownership. - Organize dairy data according to FAIR principles. - Clean and structure datasets for downstream simulation modeling. - Develop and apply naming conventions and metadata standards. - Understand why decision-support begins with disciplined data management.

# Lecture

## 1. The Reality of Dairy Farm Data

-   Diverse streams: milk meters, sensors, activity monitors, feeding systems, health logs.
-   Characteristics: heterogeneous, messy, operationally generated.
-   Importance: high-quality data improves diagnostic, predictive, and prescriptive support.

## 2. Data Ownership, Stewardship & Governance

-   Farmers as primary data owners; vendors often store/manage but do not own the data.
-   Ethical considerations: privacy, competitive sensitivity, misuse risks.
-   Governance: clear data-use agreements, access permissions, audit trails.

## 3. Data Organization Essentials

-   Tidy data principles: each row = observation; each column = variable.
-   Aligning time-series and event-based data across systems.
-   Metadata: sensor IDs, units, timestamps, sampling frequency.

## 4. FAIR Principles in Dairy Context

FAIR = **Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable**. - Findable: structured storage, logical filenames. - Accessible: secure but functional access controls. - Interoperable: open formats, consistent units. - Reusable: documentation and provenance tracking.

## 5. Naming Conventions as a Foundation for Reproducibility

-   Standardizing variable names (`cow_id`, `milk_yield_kg`).
-   File naming conventions (`2026-02-01_milkingparlor_data.csv`).
-   Folder hierarchy: `raw/`, `cleaned/`, `analysis/`, `models/`.
