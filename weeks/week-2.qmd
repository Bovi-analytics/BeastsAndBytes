# 🐄 Week 2 — Data Foundations

## 🎓 Lecture: Real Data Foundations on Dairy Farms

### 1. The Reality of Dairy Farm Data
- Diverse streams: milk meters, sensors, activity monitors, feeding systems, health logs.
- Characteristics: heterogeneous, messy, operationally generated.
- Importance: high-quality data improves diagnostic, predictive, and prescriptive support.

### 2. Data Ownership, Stewardship & Governance
- Farmers as primary data owners; vendors often store/manage but do not own the data.
- Ethical considerations: privacy, competitive sensitivity, misuse risks.
- Governance: clear data-use agreements, access permissions, audit trails.

### 3. Data Organization Essentials
- Tidy data principles: each row = observation; each column = variable.
- Aligning time-series and event-based data across systems.
- Metadata: sensor IDs, units, timestamps, sampling frequency.

### 4. FAIR Principles in Dairy Context
FAIR = **Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable**.
- Findable: structured storage, logical filenames.
- Accessible: secure but functional access controls.
- Interoperable: open formats, consistent units.
- Reusable: documentation and provenance tracking.

### 5. Naming Conventions as a Foundation for Reproducibility
- Standardizing variable names (`cow_id`, `milk_yield_kg`).
- File naming conventions (`2026-02-01_milkingparlor_data.csv`).
- Folder hierarchy: `raw/`, `cleaned/`, `analysis/`, `models/`.

## 🔬 Lab: Data Cleaning & Organization

### Lab Objectives
- Discuss real datasets needed for the project.
- How to apply FAIR-aligned organization.
- Implement a team-level naming conventions.

### Tasks
1. Decide on datasets.
2. Build a FAIR data dictionary (variables, units, descriptions).
3. Apply naming conventions to files and variables.

## 📌 Learning Outcomes
By the end of Week 2, students will be able to:
- Explain real-world data governance and ownership.
- Organize dairy data according to FAIR principles.
- Clean and structure datasets for downstream simulation modeling.
- Develop and apply naming conventions and metadata standards.
- Understand why decision-support begins with disciplined data management.
