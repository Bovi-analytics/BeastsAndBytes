# Introduction

-   Overview of data science applications in dairy farming
-   Role of decision support tools (DST) in modern dairy management
-   Motivation for data-driven decision making in animal agriculture

# Learning Objectives

By the end of this lecture, students should be able to:

-   Describe major decision support systems used in dairy farming
-   Explain how economic and biological models support farm decisions
-   Interpret applications of data integration and simulation models
-   Understand replacement, reproduction, nutrition, and environmental decision tools

# Background: Decision Support in Dairy Farming

## Decision Support Tools (DST)

-   Large collection of DST available for dairy management
-   Focus on whole-farm and cow-level decision making
-   Integration of economics, biology, and management data

## DairyMGT.info Platform

-   Centralized platform hosting numerous dairy decision tools
-   Emphasis on practical application and extension use
-   Supports replacement, feeding, reproduction, and environmental analysis

# Feeding and Nutrition Decision Tools

## FeedVal: Feed Ingredient Valuation

-   Determines actual economic value of feed ingredients
-   Based on:
    -   Nutrient composition
    -   Market prices
-   Supports ration formulation and feed purchasing decisions

## Nutritional Grouping Strategies

-   Evaluation of grouping strategies for dairy cows
-   Addresses limitations of one-size-fits-all TMR approaches
-   Uses research-based grouping methods

# Reproduction and Herd Dynamics

## Milk Curve Fitter and Pregnancy Timing

-   Projects milk production curves
-   Evaluates impact of pregnancy timing on production
-   Supports reproductive management decisions

## Reproductive Economic Assessment

-   Economic evaluation of reproductive programs
-   Comparison of synchronization strategies
-   Integration of cost, pregnancy outcomes, and returns

# Replacement and Cow Value Modeling

## Cow Replacement Problem

-   Evaluation of when to replace a cow
-   Uses:
    -   Expected future net returns
    -   Biological and economic parameters

## Cow Value Estimation

-   Long-term economic projection of individual cows
-   Comparison between:
    -   Existing cow
    -   Potential replacement
-   Accounts for pregnancy status, parity, and production stage

## Modeling Approach

-   Markov chains used to simulate herd dynamics
-   Dynamic modeling of:
    -   Milk production
    -   Reproduction
    -   Culling decisions

# Data Integration and Advanced Analytics

## Integrated Data Systems

-   Combines multiple data sources:
    -   Production
    -   Reproduction
    -   Nutrition
    -   Economics
-   Supports holistic farm-level decision making

## Whole-Farm Simulation Models

-   DairyPrint model
-   Environmental assessment tools
-   Evaluates sustainability and economic outcomes simultaneously

# Environmental and Sustainability Assessment

## Environmental Impact Modeling

-   Whole dairy farm simulation
-   Assessment of:
    -   Production efficiency
    -   Environmental footprint
-   Links management decisions to sustainability outcomes

# Key Takeaways

-   Data science enables more precise dairy management
-   Economic and biological models complement each other
-   Decision support tools translate research into practice
-   Integrated systems are critical for future dairy sustainability
