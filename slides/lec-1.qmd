# Course overview

## Homepage

[https://github.com/Bovi-analytics/](https://bovi-analytics.github.io/DairyHealthManagement/)[Beasts & Bytes](https://bovi-analytics.github.io/BeastAndBytes/)

-   All relevant course materials (and history)
-   Links to Teams, GitHub, Dodona, etc.
-   Let's take a tour!

## Activities: Prepare, Participate, Practice, Perform {.smaller}

-   **Prepare:** Introduce new content and prepare for lectures by completing the readings
-   **Participate:** Attend and actively participate in lectures and labs, herd visits
-   **Practice:** Practice your programming skills
-   **Perform:** Put together what you've learned to analyze real-world data
    -   Dodona assignments

## Grading {.smaller}

The overall team project score will be multiplied by the % of correctly submitted weekly assignments and coding exam individually.

Example:

-   Your team project is graded as a group to 16/20

-   You individually submitted 80% correct assignments
-   Your coding exam 90% correct assignments

-   Your end score is 0.8*0.9*18/20 = ...

## Support

-   Office hours
-   Ask (or even better help answering) questions during the course!!!
-   Teams
-   Reserve email for questions on personal matters

## Announcements

-   During classes or email
-   If unclear, contact me

## Diversity + inclusion {.smaller}

It is my intent that students from all diverse backgrounds and perspectives be well-served by this course, that students' learning needs be addressed both in and out of class, and that the diversity that the students bring to this class be viewed as a resource, strength and benefit.

# Course policies

## Team project

-   **Team update wednesdays** are supposed to be completed collaboratively.

-   Most of the times we will meet in classrooms at the **Morrison Hall** building.

## Academic integrity

> To uphold the [Cornell Academic Integrity Guide](https://deanoffaculty.cornell.edu/faculty-and-academic-affairs/academic-integrity/guidelines-for-students/):
>
> -   I will not lie, cheat, or steal in my academic endeavors;
>
> -   I will conduct myself honorably in all my endeavors; and
>
> -   I will act if the Code is compromised.

## Farm data

-   Be aware that

    -   the participating farmers are sharing sometimes sensitive and personal data with you (part of the course).

    -   you are supposed to use that data for educational purposes only.

    -   your professional conduct is expected.

    -   you influence future participation of the collaborating farm(s).

## Most importantly!

Ask if you're not sure if something violates a policy!

# Making Data Science Applications in Agriculture course a success

1.  Help me understanding your needs as well.
2.  Read all the preparation material (if provided) before the lesson begins.
3.  Ask questions and actively collaborate with entire team.
4.  Perform the programming assignments.
5.  Don't let a week pass by with lingering questions.
