# Introduction to decision-making 

## The project

Managing a farm = making decisions 
But how? 

## The goal of today 

Discussion and brainstorm!

## The questions 
- What kind of decisions does a dairy farmer take? 
- How do they make them? 
- What data sources do they use? 
- Which aspects need to be taken into account while making a decision?
