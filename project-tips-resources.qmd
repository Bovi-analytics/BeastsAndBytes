# 🌾 Tips & Tricks for Data Science Applications in Agriculture

## 🚀 1. Think Like a Problem-Solver, Not a Note-Taker
This course uses challenge-based learning where you solve real agricultural problems in collaboration with farmers and stakeholders.
Early in the semester, create a shared team document to track problem definitions and evolving insights.

## 📅 2. Follow the Weekly Rhythm
Lectures → weekly coding labs → project meetings. Dodona assignments are due every Monday at 24:00. Set reminders and avoid last-minute work.

## 💡 3. Coding: Small Bursts Beat Sprints
Your individual grade = group project grade × percentage of assignments you complete × coding exam.
Submit early, refine often, and test code on small inputs before using real farm datasets.

## 👩‍🌾 4. Prepare for Farmer Meetings Like a Consultant
Before meeting farmers, prepare three question types:
- Clarifying questions
- Data-oriented questions
- Impact-oriented questions

## 🧹 5. Data Governance & FAIR Principles Matter
Your project **fails automatically** if you ignore FAIR principles. Create a shared checklist covering naming conventions, documentation, and file structure.

## 📊 6. Visualize Before You Model
Generate key visuals (missing data, histograms, time series, scatter matrices) before applying algorithms.

## 🤝 7. Take Weekly Project Meetings Seriously
Arrive prepared with one question, one update, and one risk. This dramatically reduces last-minute chaos.

## 🧭 8. Scope Your Project Ruthlessly
Create a "Not Doing" list by Week 3 to keep your project realistic and implementable.

## 🎤 9. Present for Stakeholders, Not Teachers
Translate technical results into statements like:
- “This helps you decide…”
- “This reduces risk by…”

## 📝 10. Practice Strong Academic Integrity
Document all external assistance, including AI tools, and cite everything properly.
